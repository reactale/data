They sighed relieved, as now they could take the water and finally go home. The lake was deep and the water was out of reach of those two little kids. So, Jack tied a rope to his bucket and threw it inside the well.  \n\nAs soon as the bucket hit the bottom, they heard a loud humming roar. As if the sound came from all around, from the sky as well as the ground beneath them. As if someone or something got hurt. \n\nBefore they could understand anything, the entire hill shook. A land moved sideways and covered the entire lake. Oh God, they still had no idea that the lake was one of the eyes of a huge Giant. The hill was nothing but the dormant giant itself. \n\nJack and Jill felt as if the hill itself came to life and started moving. Something woke it up from its sleep. They tried to quickly run down the hill. But in slope they slipped, and kept falling, rolling, tumbling one after another. Scared to death, they surely thought they were going to die. \n\nBut then, while falling down, the crown which Jack used to wear all the time, broke down and something magical happened. The crown emitted a blast of blinding light which momentarily covered everything from between earth and sky. And, instantly, the beast slowed down. Almost still for a few minutes. And then slowly sat down. It also saved Jack and Jill from falling and helped them get up. Only then they discovered that the moving hill was actually a huge Giant. ",

            "text": "Once Upon a time there was a Kingdom. A Kingdom of might and magic, kindness and cruelty, daylight and darkness. The Kingdom was ruled by a very Noble King and a very kind Queen. And under their rule, the entire kingdom was happy and flourishing. \n\nThe king and the queen had a twin, a boy named Jack and a girl named Jill. And they were the jolliest little kids the kingdom had ever seen. Despite being the prince and the princess, they used to go out and play just like any other seven years old kid would of that kingdom. Though there were royal guards keeping eyes on them from unnoticeable distance and distance, except the king and the queen no one ever knew that. \n\nEverything was going well. Until one day, an evil witch became jealous of the queen. The witch used to live at the end of the kingdom, high on top of a mountain. One day, she stood at the edge of the mountain. Magically she conjured up a vast black cloud and she blew it over the kingdom. As the evil cloud came floating above the kingdom, it brought a nasty plague with it. People started falling ill. The king and queen became very sad to see this. They called in all the medical experts from all around the kingdom. But no one was able to find a cure. He called in the engineers and scientists to find a way to get rid of the giant black cloud floating atop the kingdom. But no one could do anything. As the days passed, people started dying. And both the King and Queen became very depressed. \n\nThen one day, the most terrible thing happened. The Queen fell ill of the same disease. Now this was the moment the witch was waiting for. The king loved the Queen with all his heart. It broke his heart just to imagine how he could rule the kingdom without the Queen by his side. He felt helpless. And he declared - “Anyone who gets rid of this grave situation and brings peace and health to the kingdom back, will be rewarded with whatever he asks for.” \n\nThe king waited and waited. But no one came. Because no one had a solution for this evil sorcery. And then one day, when the king was sitting on his throne, heartbroken and unable to focus on his daily court work, a light emerged from the black of the cloud. Everybody looked up. The light grew brighter and brighter, and from it descended a red fairy. Everyone was awed, as no one saw anything like that, ever. \n\nThe red fairy said, “Long live the King. I have come from a very faraway place to help your kingdom. I can get rid of this Cloud of Death and heal the kingdom. But there are some conditions and if those are not met, I am afraid the solution cannot be made permanent.” \n\nThe king reassured, “All your conditions will be fulfilled. Just free us from this evil. “ \n\nThe red fairy bowed. Then she again conjured up some red magical dust and blew them up towards the cloud. In a moment, the cloud dispersed away. The cheerful sound of joy could be heard from all around the kingdom. Everyone was cured. The king hastened to the Queen’s chamber. He could not wait to see the smile of his beloved wife. But alas! The queen was still unconscious.  \n\nThe king came back to his court, to the red fairy. He pleaded her to cure the Queen as well. The red fairy asked to take her to the Queen. Upon arriving to the Queen’s chamber, she asked everyone to wait outside. She said that she might be able to save the Queen but for the magic to work, she has to be alone with her. On king’s command, everyone went outside the chamber with him. They waited and waited. They could hear cultic chanting from inside and then they found red smoke coming out the room. Just as the king was about to knock the door, the red fairy opened the door.  \n\nShe said, “Your highness, I am sorry. I tried what I could. But her condition is beyond my power. Now we can only pray for her …” \n\nBack in the court, when the fairy was leaving, the King asked, “Wait, you have saved my entire kingdom and thousands of people from the Cloud of Death. I know no reward can amount for this. But still, is there anything I can do to repay your debt in any way possible?” \n\nThe red fairy smiled, and said - “I will return, when time comes …\" \n\nShe waved her wand and vanished away in red smoke. \n\nEveryone was awed again. Little Jack was awed again.  \n\nHe said, “Wow Jill, did you see that? Did you see how the red fairy came in flying and vanished away in red smoke? I wish I could do that …\" \n\nNow surprisingly, Jill did not share any of her brother's astonishments.  \n\nJill exclaimed, “Red fairy? Flying? Vanishing? What are you talking about Jack? All I could see was the black ugly witch. I did not like her at all. She walked in the door when everyone was looking at the sky, did some ugly chanting on Mother and then again walked out the door when everyone was looking at each other as if they had seen an Angel … ” \n\nLittle Jill had an unnatural power since birth, “The Vision of Truth”. No matter how thick the cloak of falsehood is, she could always see the truth. Thus, when everyone else saw a red fairy, she saw through the illusions of the evil black witch, the conjurer of the Cloud of Death. \n\n<c><b>*** </b></c>\n\nWithin a month, the queen died. And she was set to rest in peace in the catacombs beneath the palace. A few days later, when the king and the kingdom were still in grief of the Queen’s death, the red fairy appeared in the doors of the court. Seemingly weak and injured, she could hardly stand. \n\nSeeing her like that, the king and the courts men came forward to help her. \n\nThe red fairy said, “My king, the time has come. I cannot push this evil force any longer. Since that day I am fighting the Cloud of Death to keep it out of this kingdom. But now my power is depleted. And The black cloud is about to return.” \n\nThe king feared, “There must be a way to fix it. Tell me what can I do?” \n\nThe witch took the advantage. Her plan was almost successful. She quickly said, “Your majesty, it is time to keep your promise. I am only an ordinary fairy with limited power. In this state I cannot fight with all the evil powers out there. But if I become a Fairy Queen, my powers will reach to the ultimate level and only then I will be able to expel The Cloud of Death permanently. And that could only happen if you marry me.” \n\nEveryone was shocked to hear it, as they loved their queen. The king was shocked too. \n\nBut the witch played with their sympathy. With her illusion of the weak red fairy, who once saved them from the curse of death, she fell on her knees, and with sounds of agony she said, “Hurry my king, I am dying and the black cloud is coming …\" She pointed her finger to the far end of the sky and truly, there were again signs of that cursed cloud on the horizon. \n\nThere was no other way. All the wise counselors of the king advised him to agree to the Fairy’s proposal and give her the power to save them. Also, they reminded him of his promise of reward. \n\nHaving no other way, the king agreed. The black witch became the queen. All the people of the kingdom celebrated the royal marriage, as it indicated the permanent elimination of the black cloud. Little did they know back then, that this happiness was about to dissolve in a fate darker than ever. Because, the witch was everything but good. And nothing had ever been born out of her evil sorcery. \n\n<c><b>*** </b></c>\n\nOnce a lively and prosperous kingdom, sooner became a very cursed land. All greens started fading into greys. Crops and cattle started dying, the water and air became polluted, the people started falling ill. Signs of death were everywhere.  Even the king became seemingly old and weak. He could now hardly get out of his sickbed. And only one who was thriving out of all these was the Dark Queen. Like a leech she was slowly siphoning the life force out of everything in order to become more and more powerful and immortal. \n\nShe also started finding ways to kill Jack and Jill. As they were her only obstacle to the throne. And for some reason, they were immune to her evil magical powers. So, she used to make them work and do hard tasks. Tasks that any seven years old was unaccustomed of. Hoping, somehow, they would run into some accident which would kill them for good. \n\nAnd therefore, one day she commanded Jack and Jill to go up the hill and to fetch a pail of water … \n\nIt was a long way from their palace to the hill. They walked and walked, for days and night. And then, with a lot of trouble and tiredness, finally Jack and Jill reached atop the hill. \n\nNow what happened up there is a bit sketchy, because different people say different things about it. So, pick the way which your heart says is right, as Jack and Jill would have done the same, that is, would listen to what their heart says. \n\n(Pick One) ",
